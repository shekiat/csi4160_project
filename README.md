Presentation Format: Recording

For our project, we will create an automated employee check-in system that utilizes facial recognition for authentication. Our project will provide employees with a convenient way to start and end their shifts. Instead of having to login and press a button to clock-in/ out, employees will have the ability to do so by simply looking at their camera. Once clocked in, the employee will be directed to the homepage of a website. We intend to create the website with multiple pages that contain information about the employee such as an attendance log, shift information, and possibly more.

Our initial phase of this project will be configuring facial recognition using a camera attached to our Raspberry Pi. In order to do this, we will need to create a face dataset of our “employees” through many headshot photos taken at different angles. We will utilize Python and OpenCV for this task. OpenCV is an open-source software library that helps with computer vision and machine learning.
