For our project, we will create an automated employee check-in system that utilizes facial
recognition for authentication. Our project will provide employees with a convenient way to start
and end their shifts. Instead of having to login and press a button to clock-in/ out, employees will
have the ability to do so by simply looking at their camera. Once clocked in, the employee will
be directed to the homepage of a website. We intend to create the website with multiple pages
that contain information about the employee such as an attendance log, shift information, profile
information, and possibly more.
